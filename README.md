# Hydraulic Model Visualization
This is an example of a visualisation using GIS and Javascript of the results of a river engineering planning project. The study area is the Magdalena river, at Magangu√© town (Colombia). It is a riverside town that after the flood of 2010, the town presented fluvial erosion problems. The results of hydraulic modelling, velocity vectors and shear stress, obtained through Delft3D for a return period of 100 years, are shown. 

A comparison can be made of how these two hydraulic variables change before and after the inclusion of groynes.
